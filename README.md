# LeanStore

[LeanStore](https://db.in.tum.de/~leis/papers/leanstore.pdf) is a high-performance OLTP storage engine optimized for many-core CPUs and NVMe SSDs. Our goal is to achieve performance comparable to in-memory systems when the data set fits into RAM, while being able to fully exploit the bandwidth of fast NVMe SSDs for large data sets. While LeanStore is currently a research prototype, we hope to make it usable in production in the future.

## Compiling

Install dependencies:

`sudo apt-get install cmake libtbb2-dev libaio-dev libsnappy-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev liblz4-dev libzstd-dev librocksdb-dev liblmdb-dev libwiredtiger-dev liburing-dev`

`mkdir build && cd build && cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo .. && make -j`

## Benchmark Examples
### TPC-C

`build/frontend/tpcc --tpcc_warehouse_count=100 --notpcc_warehouse_affinity --ssd_path=./ssd_block_device_or_file --worker_threads=120 --pp_threads=4 --dram_gib=240 --csv_path=./log --free_pct=1 --contention_split --xmerge --print_tx_console --run_for_seconds=60 --isolation_level=si`

check `build/frontend/tpcc --help` for other options

### YCSB
`build/frontend/tpcc --ycsb_read_ratio=50 --target_gib=10 --ssd_path=./ssd_block_device_or_file --worker_threads=120 --pp_threads=4 --dram_gib=5 --csv_path=./log --free_pct=1 --contention_split --xmerge --print_tx_console --run_for_seconds=60 --isolation_level=si`
check `build/frontend/ycsb --help` for other options

## Implement Your Own Workload

LeanStore offers a flexible transactional Key/Value interface similar to WiredTiger and RocksDB.
A table is a B-Tree index where keys and values are stored in a normalized format, i.e., lexicographically ordered strings.
For convenience, frontend/shared offers templates that take care of (un)folding common types.
The best starting points are frontend/minimal-example and frontend/ycsb.
The required parameters at runtime are: `--ssd_path=/block_device/or/filesystem --dram_gib=fixed_in_gib`.
The default tranasction isolation level is `--isolation_level=si`. You can lower it to Read Committed or Read Uncommitted by replaced `si` with `rc` or `ru` respectively.
You can set the transaction isolation level using `--isolation_level=si` and enable the B-Tree techniques from CIDR202 with `--contention_split --xmerge`.

### Metrics Reporting
LeanStore emits several metrics per second in CSV files: `log_bm.csv, log_configs.csv, log_cpu.csv, log_cr.csv, log_dt.csv`.
Each row has a c_hash value, which is calculated by chaining and hashing all the configurations that you passed to the binary at runtime.
This gives you an easy way to identify your run and join all relevant information from the different CSV files using SQLite, for example."
